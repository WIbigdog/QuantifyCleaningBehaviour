# Using supervised machine learning to quantify cleaning behaviour

In coral reefs, cleaner wrasses, Labroides dimidiatus, are known for their cleaning activity. These cleaner fishes inspect client fish to mainly remove and feed on ectoparasites. 
These cleaners’ fish can interact with more than 2,000 clients daily, and some clients look for cleaners to interact around 145 times a day. 
Cleaning behaviour includes a vast repertoire from cleaning bites, client jolts, tactile stimulation, chasing, advertising dances, punishment and manipulation – all measures of cleaning motivation and interaction quality. 
The analyses of these interspecific interactions among the fish have usually been made through the manual processing of video recordings. 
Apart from being very time-consuming, manual processing can be unreliable due to variation across human observers. Automatic posture tracking and behavioural classification are rapidly becoming indispensable to studying animal behaviour accurately. 
Within this context, we introduce a semi-automated tracking system that utilizes a supervised machine learning pipeline to subsequently conduct analysis for the automatic classification of cleaning behavior events. 
Our pipeline relies on posture estimation for body part tracking of interacting individuals and we present two approaches for behaviour classification – direct mathematical quantification of behaviour, and random forests. 
Our approach offers a consistent and reliable alternative to manual video analysis of cleaning behaviour.

## All data obtained from tracking from DeepLabCut is provided here.
## Also the code used for post processing data, calculations and plots are also presenting here.

To install the used version of DeepLabCut download the [yaml file](DEEPLABCUT.yaml) and preceed to install it.
